<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

<p class="cap">THE task of mending demands so much of the time and
energy of library workers and is a factor of such economic
importance in every public library that it cannot be
put aside as incidental.</p>

<p class="indent">It is hoped that these suggestions may give definite aid
in this homely task which is ever present in all libraries.</p>

<p class="indent">No attempt has been made to give instruction in the
advanced processes of mending, as this at once encroaches
on the art of binding.</p>

<p class="indent">The best mending can be done only where an acquaintance
with the construction of the book has been acquired through
a study of the various processes of binding. Librarians are
urged to visit binderies to see the various processes; and to
study the art of binding under personal instruction of experienced
binders whenever this is feasible.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not probable that any one librarian will use all of
the processes suggested, and some of these will apply only
to exceptional cases; but the directions cover diversified conditions
in order that the librarian may have the necessary
information whenever required.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The experienced mender.</span> This handbook has not been
prepared for the use of the larger libraries where a bindery
is a part of the equipment, or where there are members of
the staff trained in binding and hence experienced menders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The inexperienced mender.</span> The purpose of this handbook
is to give practical aid and guidance to librarians who
are entirely inexperienced in the work of mending and repair
of books and whose knowledge must be gained through self-instruction.</p>

<p class="indent">The compilers have drawn upon many sources and have
endeavored to make available the suggestions received and
methods used by many librarians and practical binders, and
grateful acknowledgment is herewith made for the co-operation
and helpful suggestions received from them.</p>

<h1>Mending and Repair of Books</h1>

<hr />

<p class="h2">WHEN TO BIND OR WHEN<br />
TO MEND</p>

<p class="cap">THE question when to bind or when to mend is of daily
recurrence, and a decision must be made upon the
examination of every circulating book returned, before placing
it on the shelves. The answer will depend largely on
the policy of the library regarding the binding question.</p>

<p class="indent">No library can afford to circulate shabby, soiled or ragged
books, because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) From an economic standpoint, a book's ultimate usefulness,
or life, is materially shortened by neglect to bind
at first sign of need.</p>

<p>(2) When books are given proper care by the library,
standards are set which insure a like treatment on the
part of the reading public.</p>

<p>(3) The reading public has a right to expect that its
books shall be clean and whole, and that its property
shall be in proper condition for satisfactory use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="h3">WHEN TO BIND</p>

<p class="indent">When the stitches break and a section or a few leaves fall
out, the book should be sent to the bindery immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is happening daily with the original publishers'
bindings. If the book is removed from the shelves the
librarian is at once confronted by the problem of being
unable to answer the unceasing cry for the last new
novel, as it is the fiction which is usually in this condition.
However, if the book is allowed to circulate a
few more times there are &quot;pages missing&quot; and the book
has become valueless.</p>

<p>No book should be rebound with pages missing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When the stitches have not broken, but either a few or
all the sections have become loose:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no excuse for the librarian to leave upon her
shelves or permit to circulate books that are held together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
only by the slender threads with which they are sewed
and threatening at any moment to come tumbling forth
from the cover. Such books speak in no uncertain terms
for rebinding or permanent withdrawal from the shelves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Shall books be sent to the bindery when in greatest demand?</i></p>

<p class="indent">YES, when they cannot be circulated further without permanent
injury to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such books should be hastened through the bindery by
statement to binder regarding immediate need. If your
present binder cannot bind promptly, find one who will.</p>

<p>The prompt rebinding of a book more than doubles its
life. If the book has been reinforced at first sign of giving
way (see page 16) all the temporary assistance that
can safely be given has been rendered and if the book
is of permanent value to the library it must be rebound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="h3">WHEN TO MEND</p>

<p class="indent">When the stitches are not broken or loosened, and still
hold sections firmly together.</p>

<p class="indent">When the joints are loose.</p>

<p class="indent">When the book has once been rebound.</p>

<p class="indent">The tendency among librarians is to mend too much before
rebinding. Mending makes rebinding more difficult and
jeopardizes the life of the book.</p>

<p class="indent">It is only in rare cases, as for example when a book is
out of print, and yet valuable to the library, that a second
rebinding is justified.</p>

<p class="h3">WHEN TO REPLACE</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Will it be cheaper to mend a book and, when its short life
is done, withdraw and replace with a new copy?</i></p>

<p class="indent">YES, when the original cost is less than rebinding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;In the decision to replace, the labor of accessioning
and withdrawal must always be taken into account.</p>

<p>The fresh, clean copies of the &quot;easy books&quot; and other
good, inexpensive juvenile books are to be preferred to
rebound copies. If the original binding is so poor that a
second copy would shortly be in the same condition as the
first, it is then advisable to send the book promptly to
the bindery for recasing, preferably before circulating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Greater durability is thus insured. If the book has an
attractive original cover it is preserved and the value
of the book enhanced thereby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">YES, when the paper is of such poor quality that the
leaves break away from the stitching.</p>

<p class="indent">YES, when the book is extremely soiled; replace, even if
it costs more than rebinding.</p>

<p class="indent">YES, when a new edition, or better books on the same
subject have been published.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In replacing fiction, inexpensive editions are available for
many popular titles in the Grosset &amp; Dunlap edition,
Burt Home Library, Everyman's Library, etc.</p>

<p>Some inexpensive editions rebind and wear as well as
the first editions. Others because of narrow margins or
quality of paper do not pay to rebind. A little observation
and experience will soon prove what titles can be
rebound to advantage.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A local bindery or any binder's supply house will furnish
mending materials; also price list and samples of materials
may be obtained from the following:</p>

<p class="indent">Democrat Printing Co., Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p class="indent">Gaylord Bros., Syracuse, New York.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="p12" id="p12"></a>PASTE, THE MENDING MEDIUM</h2>

<p class="indent">Paste may be used with less danger of injury to the
book than glue, and is the only mending medium which should
be used on books that are to be rebound. Under no condition
should mucilage be used on any book which is to be
rebound. Some librarians persist in doing this and then
expect the binder to do good work. Glue should be used
only by experienced menders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hangindent"><span class="smcap">Use.</span> Paste for small surfaces is more evenly spread with
the finger, and there is less waste than with a brush.
Spread thinly, using only enough paste to make paper
stick securely.</p>

<p class="indent2">Thick paste spreads more smoothly than thin and is
not taken up quickly by the paper. This is an important
point, for if the paper stretches or expands the
work can not be done in a satisfactory way.</p>

<p class="indent2">Provide cheese cloth cut in small pieces for use in
rubbing down the pasted parts, and for keeping the
fingers clean, etc. These should be used only a few
times.</p>

<p class="indent2">Cleanliness and neatness are absolutely essential to
good mending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
There are various powdered pastes on the market used by
book-binders, bill-posters, paper-hangers and others. Spon
Tem or Steko, manufactured by Clark Paper &amp; Twine Co.,
Rochester, N. Y., and Rex Dry Paste, Geneva, N. Y., are
both excellent in adhesive qualities and easily prepared, mixing
with either hot or cold water and without cooking.</p>

<p class="indent">An excellent mixed paste is made by the Commercial
Paste Co., Columbus, Ohio, called Gleich's &quot;Gluey&quot; Paste.
This, as its name implies, has some glue mixed with it and
is quick drying and strongly adhesive. Arabol Book Glue,
Arabol Mnfg. Co., 100 William St., N. Y. City, is highly
recommended. Purchase in large or small quantities. The
various pastes used in the school &quot;hand work&quot; are good,
and come under the general name of school pastes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Recipe for Flour Paste.</span> Mix a thin batter of flour and
water, cook and as it thickens add hot water until right
consistency and until thoroughly cooked. It will be well
cooked when all milky appearance of the flour and water
has disappeared and when bubbles of air begin to explode
through the mixture. After taking from the fire a preservative
may be added if desired, such as a half teaspoonful
of oil of wintergreen to a pint of paste.</p>

<p class="indent">At times it is desirable to do some simple pasting, such
as tipping in a single leaf or label, and for such work any
good library paste is a great convenience.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="p13" id="p13"></a>WAYS TO MEND</h2>

<p class="indent">Avoid too much mending.</p>

<p class="indent">Paper used for mending should be cut lengthwise with the
grain of the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">Cloth should be cut the long way of the material.</p>

<p class="indent">In mending always use paper of lighter weight than the
book. For books printed on heavily coated paper, tissue or
bond is too light, but paper cut from margins of advertising
pages of magazines is a suitable weight.</p>

<p class="h3">PAGES</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Torn through the printing</span> may be mended as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) Use ungummed, transparent mending paper, cutting
it the size and shape of the tear, and about one-half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
inch wide. Apply a thin coat of paste to the strip and
fit it carefully over the tear, having first placed a strip
of waste paper under the torn leaf to absorb extra paste.</p>

<p>(2) For finer or better class of books, upon which more
time and care may profitably be spent, rub a very little
paste on the torn edges, place torn edges together, then
take a rather large piece of ordinary tissue paper and
rub it gently along the tear so that the tissue paper will
adhere to the torn edges.</p>

<p>Put under press, and when dry the superfluous tissue
paper should be torn off, using care to pull always toward
the tear and from both sides at the same time. The delicate
fibre of the tissue paper acts as an adhesive and it is
almost impossible to discern the way in which the mending
has been done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Torn in the margin</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use thin, firm mending paper, preferably a tint to match
paper of the book.</p>

<p>Cut a strip one-half inch wide corresponding to the size
and shape of the tear, apply paste and trim even with
the edge of the leaf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When these processes are used, place books in press or
under a weight, until thoroughly dry.</p>

<p class="indent">There are gummed papers for this purpose but care should
be taken in their selection as some are likely to darken and
discolor.</p>

<p class="h3">LEAVES</p>

<p class="indent">When loose leaves are replaced the greatest care should
be taken to make sure that they do not extend beyond the
edge of the book. If this occurs, it shows careless or inexperienced
mending.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Loose leaves</span> may be inserted in several ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) If the leaf fits exactly into the book, it may be
tipped in by applying paste to one-eighth inch of its
inner margin.</p>

<p>Place the loose leaf in the book, the outer edge even
with the book, and rub down the pasted inner margin
against the next leaf with bone folder.</p>

Illustrations may be tipped-in in this way when it is desirable
to preserve them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) If it is found by measuring that the leaf when
inserted, will extend beyond the edge of the book, fold
the leaf at the inner margin over a ruler edge, or other
straight edge, slightly more than one-eighth of an inch,
thus making a hinge. Apply paste to this hinge with
the finger. Place leaf in the book and push well back;
rub the little pasted hinge down with bone folder, being
careful to leave no free paste.</p>

<p>(3) In case the quality of the paper of the leaf to be
inserted will not stand the tipping-in process, or is badly
worn at the inner margin, it may be inserted by a guard.
Fold a half-inch strip of onion skin paper, lengthwise.
Apply a thin coat of paste to the outside of this strip.
Attach half of the strip to the inner edge of the loose
leaf, and the other half to the adjoining page in the
book, close in by the fold. Trim edge of leaf if it projects.
Put in press until dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Do not use gummed muslin for this work. It destroys
the chance of proper rebinding and detracts from the appearance
of the rebound book.</p>

<p class="h3">SECTIONS</p>

<p class="indent">When <i>more</i> than one section, sometimes called signature,
is loose in a book which is worth rebinding, it should be
rebound at once.</p>

<p class="indent">When the thread in one section only is broken, or one
section only is loose in a rebound book and the rest of the
binding is intact, the section should be inserted. To avoid
further ravelling, it is necessary to secure the broken threads
of the book either by fastening them together, or attaching
to new threads; also that the loose section is sewed or tied
through the super on the back of the book.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Loose sections</span> may be inserted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the folds of the leaves in the loose section are torn or
thin, they should be mended before replacing the section.
Take a half-inch strip of thin, firm paper, the length of
the page; fold through the middle lengthwise and paste
down through the center fold of the leaves. A touch of
paste along the fold of each will hold all the sheets
together.</p>

<p>Open the book at the place where the section is loose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
(When the book is open the back of the book separates
from the cover.)</p>

<p>Open the loose section and place it in the proper position
in the book. Near the top and bottom in the center fold
of the section will be seen the holes which were made
by the binder.</p>

<p>Thread a needle with Barbour's linen thread No. 40,
or Hayes' linen thread No. 25, and tie new thread to
broken end of thread in book.</p>

<p>Pass the needle through the hole at the top of the loose
section and out between the book and its loose back.
Do not pull the thread clear through.</p>

<p>Drop the needle and thread down between the back of
the book and the loose back to the bottom.</p>

<p>Run the needle and thread from the outside in through
the hole at the bottom of the loose section.</p>

<p>Pass the needle and thread around again in the same
way. Draw tight and tie with a hard knot at the point
of beginning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="h3">JOINTS</p>

<p class="indent">Books in the ordinary case or publishers' binding will,
after a short period of use, show signs of weakness in the
joints (where the book and cover are attached). The paper
cracks and both it and the super on the back of the book
loosen and unless immediate attention is given the stitching
breaks and the book must go to the bindery.</p>

<p class="indent">This super is a loosely woven cotton cloth which is glued
on the backs of books to help hold the sections together, and
extends from the back of the book to the inside of the cover
to help hold the book and cover together. In the publishers'
bindings, this super is usually all that holds a book in the
cover.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Loose joints</span> may be</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Reinforced</span> by tightening and stripping.</p>

<p>Hold the book open in an upright position on the table.
The back will separate in a curve from body of book;
with the round brush apply paste between the loose
back and the book, along the joints only. If too much
paste is used it will spread over the back, causing the
cloth cover to become wrinkled and title illegible. Close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
the book, care being taken to push book well back in
cover, and with bone folder rub well along the joints,
squeezing out any extra paste at head and foot. Dry
under weight for a half-day at least.</p>

<p>Then with knife clean off the ragged edges of torn
paper along the joint inside the cover. Place the book
flat upon the table, the front cover open, take book of
similar thickness and place under open cover.</p>

<p>Take a strip of muslin or paper. Cut this strip the
exact length of the book, and apply thick paste so that
the paper or cloth will not stretch.</p>

<p>Paste one-half of this strip to the fly-leaf and the other
half of the strip on the cover of the book. Make sure
that the strip is smoothly laid, not stretched too tightly
from book to cover, or it will pull up first pages when
book is used; if too loosely stretched it is unsightly and
fails of its purpose; allow the book to remain open until
the strip is dry. Repeat this process for the back cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="h3">RECASING</p>

<p class="indent">When the stitching has not broken, and the paper is of
good quality a book may be removed entirely from its cover
and recased.</p>

<p class="indent">In recasing, painstaking care is required and books must
be in condition specified to obtain satisfactory results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Take a sharp knife and cut through the super at both
joints. This super is easily lifted from the inside of the
book cover. Pull it off the back of the book, taking great
care in this, and remove all particles of dried glue.</p>

<p class="indent">Take white outing flannel, which is light in weight and
double-faced, or canton flannel (downy side towards the
book), or cheesecloth. Cut a strip as long as the back
of the book and two inches wider; paste this over the
back only, allowing an inch extension on each side. Do
not, in this first process, put paste on the extensions.
Draw the cloth over the rounded edges of the back (or
joints); rub the back well with bone folder and also
over the rounded edges, but do not paste the cloth down
beyond the rounded edges. During this process hold the
back of the book so that the sections, or signatures, will
not separate. After thorough rubbing let dry.</p>

<p class="indent">Apply paste to inside of book covers one inch next to the
joints; do not put paste on back of book. Place book in
cover, pushing well back, making sure that it is correctly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
placed. Paste down the one-inch extension of cloth,
laying waste paper between it and book; close book,
rub joints well with bone folder and allow to dry
thoroughly.</p>

<p class="indent">Strip joints, following instructions for re-inforcing; paste
clean paper lining on book covers, press and dry. The
book should then be opened as carefully as a new book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="h3">PRESSING</p>

<p class="indent">This adds greatly to the appearance of the mended or
repaired books. Do not place weights over the rounded back
of a book.</p>

<p class="indent">Place the pressing boards or tins over the covers of the
book only, even with, but not extending over, the joints.</p>

<p class="indent">Pressure on the rounded back will weaken a book in the
most vital part.</p>

<p class="h3">DO NOT&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangindent">use too much paste.</p>

<p class="hangindent">use Lepage's glue or any mucilage.</p>

<p class="hangindent">use cloth strips in a book except at the joint.</p>

<p class="hangindent">paste heavily up the back unless a very old and not valuable
book.</p>

<p class="hangindent">overmend on a book which will ultimately be bound.</p>

<p class="hangindent">allow loose pages to be slipped up in the book above the
top of book.</p>

<p class="hangindent">use heavier paper for patching than paper of book.</p>

<p class="h3">ALWAYS&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangindent">handle books carefully.</p>

<p class="hangindent">allow sufficient drying.</p>

<p class="hangindent">have plenty of waste papers and discard when soiled.</p>

<p class="hangindent">wash brushes well each day.</p>

<p class="hangindent">pile up books alternating the backs with the foredges.
They will stand erect and not slip or slide.</p>

<p class="h3">MISSING PAGES</p>

<p class="indent">When a page is missing and it is impossible to replace the
book with a new copy, the page may be typewritten and
tipped in.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
When it is necessary to rebind the book, the margin of
the typewritten page should be left an inch wider on each side
than the regular margin. This is for the convenience of the
binder, who will trim down the margin in process of rebinding.</p>

<p class="indent">Make typewritten page conform to size and shape of
printed page.</p>

<p class="h3">NOTATION FOR DAMAGES</p>

<p class="indent">When there is an injury to a book which is allowed to
remain in circulation, the reading public should be made
aware that the damage is known to the library by a notation,
with date, near the injury, e.g.,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Damage noted 1 Mr. '20, Free Public Library.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="p19" id="p19"></a>WAYS TO CLEAN</h2>

<p class="indent">The book should be cleaned as well as mended. Careful
attention should be given to the cleanliness of the books in
circulation. There is nothing that more quickly creates a
distaste for the use of a public library than the handling of
soiled and grimy books.</p>

<p class="indent">Careful study of the paper upon which books are printed
is necessary, and in cleaning the fact that different papers
and finishes require different treatment must be taken into
account. The spongy feather-weight paper upon which much
of the fiction is printed is difficult to clean. Pencil marks
may be erased with art gum used gently; soil of any other
kind is almost impossible to remove. Heavily clay-coated
paper may be cleaned with powdered pumice or a hard
eraser. Highly calendered paper and any hand made paper
may be cleaned with a damp cloth; cleaning but a few
pages at a time and allowing book to remain open until dry.</p>

<p class="h3">PAGES</p>

<p class="indent">Soiled pages may be cleaned in the following ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With art gum, rub gently and slowly, holding the page
flat with the left hand to prevent tearing.</p>

<p>With powdered pumice stone, rub on with a clean cloth.
With damp cloth, be careful that cloth is not too wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Rub always from inner margin of the page outward, to
prevent crumpling.</p>

<p>Brush off carefully all particles of rubber, or pumice
stone, allowing none to remain in the folds between the
leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mud stains may be removed by using a soft brush or
sponge, with a preparation of the following proportions:
One cup water, one teaspoon ammonia, four drops carbolic
acid. Avoid too much rubbing or print will blur. Slip the
pressing tin under the page, and after washing, place white
blotting paper on each side of the leaf.</p>

<p class="indent">Ink stains may be removed by one of the standard ink
eradicators to be obtained of local stationer or druggist.</p>

<p class="indent">Edges of the leaves may be cleaned by sandpapering, holding
the leaves of the book very firmly together, or putting
book into press.</p>

<p class="h3">COVERS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Soiled covers</span> may be cleaned by using a hard eraser,
pumice stone or soap and water. The best results are
obtained by the use of the following wash:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two parts good vinegar and one part water. Apply
with a clean cloth and rub hard until dirt is removed,
then place upright to dry. This should not be used on
leather.</p>

<p>The book should then be shellacked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Shellacked covers.</span> New books may receive preliminary
care by shellacking before placing in circulation. Shellacking
the covers, especially those in light colors, provides great
protection from dirt, and they are then easily washed with
the vinegar and water. Another coat of shellac is advisable
after washing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To shellac, hold the book by the printed matter and
apply the shellac, which may be diluted with a little
wood alcohol, taking care to shellac the edges well. Give
two coats; between coats suspend on a cord over night
to dry. After the last coat, rub with soft cloth slightly
oiled with olive oil. This prevents sticking.</p>

<p>If the books are labeled before shellacking, the ink
must be allowed to dry thoroughly or it may run; in
removing the labels, use wood alcohol first to cut the
shellac and then soak off with blotting paper and water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
Care should be taken in the selection of the shellac; if
not, the books will be gummy and hard.</p>

<p class="indent">The leather on bound magazines and books often becomes
very dry and will split and crack. This is especially true of
books not greatly used, as the oil of the hands acts as a
great preservative. To prevent this cracking and splitting,
some oil is necessary. Vaseline is good for this, applied with
a cotton pad covered with a soft cloth, and should remain
on the leather for a day to permit absorption of the oil.
Some leathers will absorb a second application, after which
books may be rubbed down and returned to shelves. The
oil or vaseline does not harm the gilding. This may be
done once a year, depending upon the condition of heat in
library and upon age and condition of leather bound books.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Worn covers</span> may be replaced on books with leather backs
by removing cloth from the boards dry, and using this as a
pattern from which to cut new cloth or paper. Reline inside
of boards with paper.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Covers split at joint.</span> Strips of cloth in assorted colors
may be obtained with other mending supplies to reinforce
covers split at the joints.</p>

<p class="indent">This cloth may be obtained gummed or ungummed; if
ungummed, use paste; if gummed, moisten with thin paste.</p>

<h2><a name="p21" id="p21"></a>BINDING RECORD</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Preparation of books for the bindery.</span> Closely related
to the work of mending and repair of books is the preparation
of books for the bindery. Binders have complained of
the careless and unbusiness-like methods of some librarians
in this matter. Attention should always be given to the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Handle a book to be bound with more care than when
the binding is sound.</p>

<p>Collate every book to make sure that no pages are missing,
unless it is ascertained that the binder includes this
process in his work.</p>

<p>Many librarians have ceased to make bindery slips,
except in the case of important books requiring complicated
titles or for magazines. When slip is not made, an excellent
way to indicate the lettering for the back of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
book is to underscore lightly in lead pencil on title page,
the specific words in title desired; for author underscore
twice.</p>

<p>The material to be used for binding is generally decided
upon in advance by conference or correspondence
with binder.</p>

<p>Magazines should be carefully examined to make sure
that each volume is complete, including title page and
index. The librarian should write to the publisher for
these, if they are not received within a reasonable time
after the volume is completed. If missing, instruct binder
to bind in stubs so that they may be inserted when
obtained.</p>

<p>In giving directions for magazines to be bound with
stubs, state whether stubs are to be at the beginning
or end of the volume. Look over previous volumes of
set that your volumes may be uniform in the placing of
the index, and follow the printer's arrangement.</p>

<p>Send an alphabetical list of the books to the bindery for
checking purposes. Keep a duplicate copy.</p>

<p>File alphabetically in charging tray the book cards that
have been removed from the books; charge these to the
bindery.</p>

<p>Magazines should have a bindery slip made and a
sample volume already bound sent that each set may be
uniform as to color of cover, lettering, etc. A rubbing
of a bound volume can easily be made and sent in place
of the volume. If the binder has previously bound magazines
for you he has doubtless made sample backs for
his own convenience. The slip should show definitely
the placing and abbreviations of volume numbers, dates,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When books are returned from the bindery.</span> Examine
carefully for flexibility&mdash;should not be too stiff and hard
to open; evenness of cover; compactness; correct and even
lettering; reasonably wide margins.</p>

<p class="indent">Check books with duplicate list.</p>

<p class="indent">Pay no bills until all mistakes are rectified. Mistakes
in lettering can be corrected, and when this occurs return
to the bindery.</p>

<p class="indent">Enter in accession book under &quot;remarks,&quot; opposite the
entry of each book the date when the book was rebound:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
e. g., &quot;reb'd 1 Jc., '20&quot;; also on inside of lower front cover
near the joint. A rubber stamp at small expense may be
ordered from any stamp works, with the word &quot;reb'd&quot; to be
inserted in the pencil date holder with the date. This saves
writing.</p>

<p class="indent">Enter on the monthly report blank the total number of
books rebound. (This gives data for yearly total and obviates
the necessity of keeping binding book.)</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="p23" id="p23"></a>TEMPORARY BINDERS</h2>

<p class="indent">The Gaylord Bros.' red rope binder provides an inexpensive
magazine binder, both for the current periodicals in use
in the reading room and those in circulation. The cover of
the magazine may be pasted on the outside of the binder, and
after the current month the magazine may be circulated just
as a book, without damage for future binding. A good
quality of wrapping paper may be used in place of the red
rope paper. It is less expensive and wears fairly well.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
